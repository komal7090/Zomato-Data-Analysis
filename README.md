# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Python project analyzing Zomato restaurant data using Pandas and Matplotlib 

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of restaurant data from Zomato, one of India's largest food delivery platforms. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about restaurant distribution, cuisine preferences, cost trends, and ratings across different cities. This analysis was performed using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and popular data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
